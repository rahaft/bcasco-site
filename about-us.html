          <h2>Welcome to BCASCO</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to BCASCO, an association of volunteers that provides a forum to exchange
            information about, and take action on, issues of interest to senior citizens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to provide a better quality of life for all people. We seek, for instance,
            better education, housing, and health care for the old, for the poor, as well as for
            the wealthy. We welcome into membership any like-minded organizations and individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our history dates back to the Seventies, when a small group of people had an idea.
            Now we are a vital part of the Baltimore County community, with many significant
            individual and organizational members.

          <h2>Advocacy</h2>
          <p>
            Among our concerns are legislation on the county, state, and federal levels, and each
            year we choose our priorities. When we do take a stand, we're sure to study the issue
            before advocating a position. We urge our members and all citizens to keep in touch
            with their legislators.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently Social Security is a major concern, so we are urging citizens to contact
            their federal legislators. To keep citizens connected with their state legislators,
            we provide transportation to Annapolis and the USM Rally during the annual
            General Assembly.
